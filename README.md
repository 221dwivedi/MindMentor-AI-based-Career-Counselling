# MindMentor-AI-based-Career-Counselling
The practice of assisting people in locating and pursuing occupations that are a good fit for their abilities, interests, and goals is known as career counselling. Although it can be a useful tool for individuals of all ages, students and young adults just starting their professions should pay particular attention to it.

Career coaching is one of the many professions that artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly transforming. Compared to traditional career counselling services, AI-powered platforms can offer students and young people more timely, tailored guidance.
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to various means of integration of AI aimed to provide efficiency in tasks, one of which is career counseling.

**OVERVIEW**

In the ever-evolving landscape of education, effective career guidance is crucial for shaping high school students' futures. Traditional counseling methods often lack personalization and scalability, necessitating innovative solutions. Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our proposed AI-based counselling system aims to revolutionize career guidance for grades 9-12 by leveraging cutting-edge technology. Through AI, it provides personalized insights based on individual strengths, weaknesses, interests, and aspirations. This presentation will delve into the details of our AI system, demonstrating how HTML, CSS, and JS create a user-friendly interface. Additionally, we'll explore how Natural Language Processing (NLP) humanizes the system, enabling it to understand and respond to students' queries in a natural and intuitive manner.​
